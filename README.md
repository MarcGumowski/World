World
============

World implements a world map made with D3.js.

The data are manipulated using R and then converted into .json format, while the coordinates come from a slightly modified version of the pre-built world110m.geojson file.

The chart represents the total average tariffs applied by the countries in the world and their respective imports for the year 2014 (or the closest available year with data). Trade statistics used to build the dataset come from the World Tariff Profile 2016 publication and can be found in the databases of the WTO, ITC or UNCTAD. More information on the WTO web site: [Statistics](https://www.wto.org/statistics).
